## Transportation To/From Toronto  

### By Air 

#### Lester B. Pearson International Airport (YYZ)  

Air Canada, West Jet and many US carriers provide direct flights to Toronto. Lester B. Pearson International Airport is located west of the downtown core, and is readily accessible. The downtown Toronto hotels are approximately 16 km from Lester B. Pearson International Airport.

To get to downtown from YYZ:

* Union Pearson Express (UPX) Train (recommended): An express train connects Pearson Airport with Union Station in downtown Toronto in 25 minutes. There are 2 other stations before Union Station. Rates are dependent on the destination station with tickets to Union Station costing $12.35 one-way. Tickets can be purchased online or before boarding the train. More information can be found [here](http://www.upexpress.com). Once at Union Station, transferring to public transit is simple (see below).

* Public transit: The TTC, Toronto's public transit system, also provides [Airport Service](http://www3.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Airport_service.jsp) and is the least expensive method at $3.25 of getting to and from downtown Toronto. To access bus service from the Airport to TTC Kipling Station take "192 Airport Rocket". Service occurs all day, every day between 5:30am and 2am and between Kipling Station and Pearson Airport. Buses stop only at Kipling Station, Dundas Street West and East Mall Crescent, then Jetliner Road at Airport Road (Ground Level), then Terminal 1 (Ground Level), then Terminal 3 (Arrivals Level). One-way travel time to the subway is approx. 20 minutes. The closest subway station to 661 University Ave. is Queens Park on the University/Spadina line. 661 University Ave. is located at the corner of University and College. Fares need to be paid in cash on the bus or with tokens that can be purchased at TTC stations.

* Limousine/Taxi service: Limousines (fixed rate) are marginally cheaper than taxis (meter) for the trip downtown. Both the Taxis and the Limousines can be located immediately outside any airport terminal on the Arrivals Level. You can reserve a Limousine by:
  * Airport Services (1-800-263-6135)  
  * Air Flight Services (1-800-268-6843)  
  * Aeroport Taxi and Limousine Services (1-800-465-3434)  
The trip downtown could take from 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on traffic. The fixed-rate taxi/limo fares to downtown are between CAD$60-80 to 661 University Ave.

####	Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ)  

Located on the western tip of a series of islands in Toronto Harbor, the island airport handles scheduled, private and corporate flights. [Porter Airlines](https://www.flyporter.com/en-ca/) and [Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home.html) operate out of this airport. To get off the Island, you can walk through the new pedestrain tunnel or take the TCCA 1 ferry. A free shuttle bus can take you to Union Station.
